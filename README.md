# Kindergarten project


## About the project

  The project is about assigning new children to a kindergarten. You have different menus if you are an admin or a normal user. As an admin, you can modify delete or create new users. As a normal user you can just preview data. 
  
## Future improvements

  We will add the feature to the program to determine if you can be accept in the kindergarten, using the distance between the place where you live and the building.
